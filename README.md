# Back end :

I used a neon database,
Node and typescript for the server,
multiple models, controllers, routers for my tables 

Each table has CRUD implemented .

# Front end :
I used react with vite and typeScript. I setted up multiple slices to be connected to each table of my DB.
I did customed hooks to keep my components cleaner. All the fetches of my APIS are handled in the redux states.
